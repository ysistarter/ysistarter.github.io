> I have been teaching higher education since 2018. My first role was as an instructor at UC Berkeley. Since then, I've had the honor of teaching data analytics and visualization at a number of schools as a guest instructor. My work as an instructor was recently highighted in an article by UC Berkeley Extension's Voices Blog:  *Black Data Scientists Are Starting to Write the Story* _Instructor Ysis Tarter brings her knowledge to Extension to create more storytellers_. I also teach workshops and speak at conferences on various topics, from introductory python workshops to speaking on industry standards in synthetic biology. Some of which are listed below.
